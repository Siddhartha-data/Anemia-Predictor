# Anemia-Predictor
Anemia Predictor: Your Health Guardian
# Anemia Prediction Flask Application

## Project Overview
This project is a Flask web application that predicts the likelihood of anemia based on user input of blood parameters. It uses a machine learning model (GradientBoostingClassifier) trained on a medical dataset, with input features scaled using StandardScaler for accurate predictions.

## Project Structure
- `app.py`: Main Flask application. Handles web routes, loads the model and scaler, processes user input, and renders results.
- `anemia_model.py`: Model training script. Loads data, performs EDA, trains several models, saves the best model (`model.pkl`) and the scaler (`scaler.pkl`).
- `model.pkl`: Trained GradientBoostingClassifier model, saved with pickle.
- `scaler.pkl`: StandardScaler object fitted on the training data, saved with pickle. Ensures input data is scaled the same way during prediction.
- `anemia.csv`: The dataset used for training and testing the model.
- `/static`: Contains static files (CSS, images).
- `/templates`: Contains HTML templates (`index.html`, `predict.html`).
- `/forms`: (Unused in this version, reserved for future form logic.)
- `requirements.txt`: List of required Python packages.

## Setup Instructions
1. **Install required packages:**
   ```sh
   pip install flask numpy scikit-learn pandas matplotlib seaborn
   ```
2. **Ensure the following files are present in the project root:**
   - `app.py`
   - `anemia_model.py`
   - `anemia.csv`
   - `model.pkl` (generated by running `anemia_model.py`)
   - `scaler.pkl` (generated by running `anemia_model.py`)

3. **Train the model and save the scaler:**
   - Run the training script:
     ```sh
     python anemia_model.py
     ```
   - This will generate `model.pkl` and `scaler.pkl` in the project root.

4. **Run the Flask application:**
   ```sh
   python app.py
   ```
   - Open your browser and go to: [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000)

## How Prediction Works
1. **User Input:**
   - The user enters gender, hemoglobin, MCH, MCHC, and MCV values in the web form.
2. **Input Processing:**
   - The app loads both `model.pkl` and `scaler.pkl` at startup.
   - User input is converted to a numpy array and scaled using the loaded scaler.
3. **Prediction:**
   - The scaled input is passed to the model for prediction.
   - The result and reasons (if anemic) are displayed on the results page.

## Key Implementation Details
- **Model:** GradientBoostingClassifier (scikit-learn)
- **Scaler:** StandardScaler (scikit-learn)
- **Input Order:** [Gender, Hemoglobin, MCH, MCHC, MCV]
- **Both model and scaler are required for accurate predictions.**
- **All code is compatible with scikit-learn 1.5.2.**

## Troubleshooting
- If you see errors about missing attributes or version incompatibility, ensure you:
  - Retrain and re-save the model and scaler in your current environment.
  - Use the same scikit-learn version for both training and prediction.
- If you see errors about missing files, ensure `anemia.csv`, `model.pkl`, and `scaler.pkl` are present.

## Customization
- To use a different model or dataset, update `anemia_model.py` and re-run it to generate new `model.pkl` and `scaler.pkl`.
- You can adjust the web UI by editing files in `/templates` and `/static`.
